description: >
  Detects the execution of BusyBox with sudo privileges to spawn shells (sh, ash), 
  which can lead to privilege escalation on Linux systems. BusyBox is a multi-call 
  binary that combines many Unix utilities, and its shell capabilities can be abused 
  to gain root access.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility 
  including the shell spawning via busybox.

known_false_positives: >
  Embedded systems or minimal Linux installations may legitimately use BusyBox 
  for administrative tasks. Filter based on known system administration patterns 
  and expected environments.
