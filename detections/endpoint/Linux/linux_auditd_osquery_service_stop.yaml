description: >
  Detects suspicious stopping of the osquery service, which may indicate an attempt 
  to disable monitoring and evade detection. Osquery is a powerful tool used for 
  querying system information and detecting anomalies, and stopping its service can 
  be a sign that an attacker is trying to disrupt security monitoring or hide 
  malicious activities.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  SERVICE_STOP event monitoring enabled. Osquery must be installed on monitored 
  endpoints for this detection to be relevant.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrator or network operator may stop osquery for maintenance, updates, or 
  troubleshooting. Filter based on known maintenance windows and authorized users.
