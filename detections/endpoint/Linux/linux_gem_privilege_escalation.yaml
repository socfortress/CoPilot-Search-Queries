description: >
  Detects the execution of Ruby Gem with elevated privileges that could lead to 
  privilege escalation. The gem command can execute arbitrary code through the 
  'open' command with -e flag or 'exec' command. If gem is granted sudo rights, 
  attackers can spawn shells or execute system commands as root.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring and Tetragon process execution logging enabled. Ruby and gem must 
  be installed on the system.

known_false_positives: >
  Ruby developers may use gem with various commands legitimately. However, the 
  combination of sudo + gem open/exec with shell commands (-e, system()) is 
  rarely legitimate. Filter based on known development environments.

    Gem privilege escalation detected on $agent_name$. 
    The sudo gem open/exec pattern can execute arbitrary commands as root.
