description: >
  Detects the execution of the 'gdrive' tool on Linux hosts. This tool allows 
  standard users to perform tasks associated with Google Drive via the command line. 
  Threat actors use gdrive to stage tools as well as exfiltrate data. Associated 
  with UNC3886 China-Nexus threat activity.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  process execution logging enabled. Auth.log monitoring provides sudo command 
  visibility for gdrive binary deployment.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators may legitimately use gdrive for backup or automation purposes. 
  Filter based on known administrative users and expected usage patterns.
