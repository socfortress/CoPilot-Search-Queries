description: >
  Detects the use of the 'find' command with 'sudo' and '-exec' options, which can 
  indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system. This GTFOBins 
  technique allows execution of arbitrary commands as root through find's -exec 
  parameter, potentially leading to a root shell.

data_source:
  - auth.log
  - Tetragon

  index_pattern: "${INDEX_PATTERN}"
  size: 100
  sort:
    - timestamp: desc

parameters:
  AGENT_NAME:
    description: "Target agent/host name"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "Amine"
  CUSTOMER_CODE:
    description: "Customer label for filtering"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "lab"
  START_TIME:
    description: "Query start time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now-24h"
    example: "2026-02-04 00:00:00.000"
  END_TIME:
    description: "Query end time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-02-04 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility 
  including the commands executed via find's -exec parameter.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators and automated tooling may legitimately use find with -exec 
  for batch file operations. Filter based on known administrative activities and 
  expected command patterns.

    Find privilege escalation attempt detected on $agent_name$. 
    The find -exec pattern can execute arbitrary commands as root.
