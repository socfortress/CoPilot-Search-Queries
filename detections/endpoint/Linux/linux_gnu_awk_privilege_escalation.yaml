description: >
  Detects the execution of the 'gawk' command with elevated privileges using the 
  'BEGIN{system()}' pattern, which can allow a user to execute system commands as 
  root. This GTFOBins technique abuses gawk's ability to run arbitrary system 
  commands, enabling privilege escalation.

data_source:
  - auth.log
  - Tetragon

    type: datetime

    example: "2026-02-04 00:00:00.000"
  END_TIME:
    description: "Query end time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-02-04 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators and developers may legitimately use gawk for text processing. 
  However, the 'BEGIN{system()}' pattern with sudo is rarely used legitimately. 
  Filter based on known scripting workflows.
