description: >
  Detects the execution of sudo or su commands on a Linux system. These commands 
  are commonly used by adversaries to elevate privileges, potentially leading to 
  unauthorized access or control over the system. If confirmed malicious, this 
  activity could allow attackers to execute commands with root privileges.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  process execution logging enabled. Auth.log monitoring provides additional 
  sudo command visibility. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming 
  convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators regularly use sudo and su for legitimate system administration. 
  Filter based on known administrative users and expected command patterns. 
  High frequency or unusual commands should be investigated.
