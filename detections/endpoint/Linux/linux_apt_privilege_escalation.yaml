description: >
  Detects the use of apt with Pre-Invoke options which can be abused for privilege 
  escalation. The apt package manager supports Pre-Invoke and Post-Invoke hooks that 
  execute commands before and after package operations. Adversaries with sudo access 
  to apt can leverage these hooks to execute arbitrary commands as root, bypassing 
  restricted shell environments.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to 
  capture command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index 
  naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Pre-Invoke hooks are rarely used in normal operations. Legitimate use cases may 
  include custom package management scripts or system hardening tools, but these 
  should be well-documented. Any detection should be investigated.
