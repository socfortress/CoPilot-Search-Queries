description: >
  Detects the use of the 'make' command with elevated privileges to execute system 
  commands as root, potentially leading to a root shell. The make --eval flag allows 
  arbitrary command execution through Makefile syntax. If confirmed malicious, an 
  attacker could achieve full control over the system and compromise the entire 
  environment.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring and Tetragon process execution logging enabled. The make utility 
  is commonly installed on development systems.

known_false_positives: >
  Build systems and developers may use make with various flags. However, the 
  combination of sudo + make --eval with shell commands is rarely legitimate. 
  Filter based on known build environments and CI/CD pipelines.

    Make privilege escalation detected on $agent_name$. 
    The sudo make --eval pattern can execute arbitrary commands as root.
