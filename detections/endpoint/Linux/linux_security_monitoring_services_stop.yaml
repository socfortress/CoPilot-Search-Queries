  Detects suspicious security monitoring service stop events. This includes Sysmon, 
  Tetragon, Wazuh agent, auditd, and other security services. Stopping these services 
  may indicate attempts to evade detection or disable security monitoring capabilities.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  service monitoring enabled. Configure auditd to capture SERVICE_STOP events. 
  The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators may legitimately stop security services during maintenance or 
  upgrades. Filter based on known maintenance windows and authorized users.

    Security monitoring service activity detected on $agent_name$. 
    Stopping services like Sysmon, Tetragon, or Wazuh may indicate defense evasion.
