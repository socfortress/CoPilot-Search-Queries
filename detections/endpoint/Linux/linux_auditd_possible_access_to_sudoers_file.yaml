description: >
  Detects potential access or modification of the /etc/sudoers file on a Linux system.
  The sudoers file controls user permissions for executing commands with elevated 
  privileges. This activity could indicate an attacker attempting to gain persistence 
  or escalate privileges, compromising the security of the targeted host. Associated 
  with Cobalt Strike and China-Nexus threat activity.

  - Tetragon

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  process execution logging enabled. Auth.log monitoring provides sudo command 
  visibility. Correlate with EXECVE or PROCTITLE events to identify the process 
  or user responsible.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators may access sudoers files for legitimate privilege management. 
  Filter based on known administrative users and expected maintenance windows.
