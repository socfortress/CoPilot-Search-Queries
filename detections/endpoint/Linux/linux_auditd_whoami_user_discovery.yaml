description: >
  Detects the suspicious use of the whoami command, which may indicate an attacker 
  trying to gather information about the current user account on a compromised system. 
  The whoami command is commonly used to verify user privileges and identity, especially 
  during initial stages of an attack to assess the level of access.

data_source:
  - Tetragon
  - Linux Auditd
  - auth.log

  index_pattern: "${INDEX_PATTERN}"
  size: 100
  sort:
    - timestamp: desc

    bool:
      must:
        - term:
            agent_name: "${AGENT_NAME}"

  AGENT_NAME:
    description: "Target agent/host name"

    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-02-03 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. The index pattern should match your 
  Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators may legitimately use whoami for troubleshooting or scripts. 
  Filter based on known automation scripts and authorized users. High frequency 
  of whoami execution may indicate reconnaissance.

response:
  message: >
    Whoami command execution detected on $agent_name$. 
    This may indicate user discovery or reconnaissance activity.
