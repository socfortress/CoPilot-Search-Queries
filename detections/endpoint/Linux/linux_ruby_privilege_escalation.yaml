description: >
  Detects the execution of Ruby commands with elevated privileges on a Linux system. 
  This identifies processes where Ruby is used with the -e flag to execute commands 
  via sudo. This activity indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt using 
  GTFOBins techniques, allowing a user to execute commands as root.

data_source:
  - Tetragon
  - Linux Auditd

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Note that auditd hex-encodes commands 
  with special characters, so the query includes the hex pattern for "ruby" (72756279).

known_false_positives: >
  False positives may occur from automated tooling or legitimate system administrative 
  usage of Ruby scripts. Filter as needed based on authorized Ruby usage patterns.
