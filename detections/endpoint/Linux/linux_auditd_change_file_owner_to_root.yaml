description: >
  Detects the use of chown command to change file ownership to root. This activity 
  may indicate an attacker attempting to escalate privileges by changing ownership 
  of files or scripts to root, potentially enabling execution with elevated privileges 
  or persistence mechanisms.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to 
  capture command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index 
  naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators may legitimately change file ownership to root during 
  software installation, configuration management, or system maintenance. Package 
  managers and automated deployment tools may also trigger this detection.
