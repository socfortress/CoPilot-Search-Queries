description: >
  Detects the use of curl command with proxy-related arguments such as -x, socks, 
  --preproxy, and --proxy. This activity may indicate an adversary attempting to 
  use a proxy to evade network monitoring and obscure their actions, potentially 
  leading to unauthorized data access or exfiltration.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to capture 
  command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming 
  convention.

known_false_positives: >
  False positives may be present based on legitimate proxy usage internally for 
  development, testing, or corporate proxy requirements. Filter as needed based 
  on authorized proxy configurations.
