description: >
  Detects the execution of MySQL commands with elevated privileges using sudo, 
  specifically when MySQL is used with the -e flag and shell escape (\!) to execute 
  system commands. This GTFOBins technique allows attackers to gain root shell access 
  through MySQL's shell escape functionality.

data_source:
  - auth.log
  - Tetragon

parameters:
  AGENT_NAME:
    description: "Target agent/host name"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "Amine"
  CUSTOMER_CODE:
    description: "Customer label for filtering"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "lab"
  START_TIME:
    description: "Query start time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now-24h"
    example: "2026-02-03 00:00:00.000"
  END_TIME:
    description: "Query end time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-02-03 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility. 
  The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Database administrators may legitimately use MySQL with the -e flag for scripting. 
  The shell escape pattern (\!) is rarely used legitimately. Filter based on known 
  administrative users and expected database operations.
