description: >
  Detects auditd daemon shutdown events (type=DAEMON_END) which indicate the audit 
  daemon has been stopped. While this may occur during legitimate system shutdown 
  or maintenance, unexpected daemon stops could indicate an attacker attempting to 
  disable auditing to evade detection before performing malicious activities.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  logging enabled. The auditd service must be configured to log daemon events. 
  The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System shutdowns, scheduled reboots, and legitimate administrative actions 
  will trigger auditd daemon end events. Correlate with system shutdown times 
  and change management windows to reduce false positives.
