description: >
  Detects the execution of PHP commands with elevated privileges on a Linux system, 
  specifically when PHP is used with -r flag and 'system' function. This GTFOBins 
  technique abuses PHP's system() function to execute arbitrary commands as root, 
  potentially leading to full system compromise.

data_source:
  - auth.log

search:
  index_pattern: "${INDEX_PATTERN}"
  size: 100
  sort:
    - timestamp: desc
  query:
    bool:
      must:
        - term:
            agent_name: "${AGENT_NAME}"
        - term:
            agent_labels_customer: "${CUSTOMER_CODE}"
        - wildcard:
            full_log: "*php*-r*system*"
        - range:
            timestamp:

parameters:
  AGENT_NAME:
    description: "Target agent/host name"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "Amine"
  CUSTOMER_CODE:
    description: "Customer label for filtering"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "lab"
  START_TIME:
    description: "Query start time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now-24h"
    example: "2026-02-04 00:00:00.000"
  END_TIME:
    description: "Query end time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-02-04 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. The pattern detects PHP -r with system() function calls 
  executed via sudo.

known_false_positives: >
  Developers may legitimately use PHP scripts with system calls. However, the 
  combination of sudo + php -r + system() is rarely used legitimately. Filter 
  based on known development workflows.
