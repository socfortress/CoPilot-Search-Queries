description: >
  Detects the use of 'curl' and 'wget' commands within a Linux environment for 
  potential ingress tool transfer. These utilities are commonly used for downloading 
  files, which can indicate potential malicious tool downloads. Monitoring helps 
  identify and differentiate between normal and potentially harmful usage.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  process execution logging enabled. Tetragon captures full command-line arguments 
  and network connection details via kprobes.

known_false_positives: >
  Legitimate use of curl and wget for system updates, package downloads, API calls, 
  and administrative tasks. Filter based on known administrative patterns, expected 
  URLs, and authorized users.
