description: >
  Detects auditd daemon abort events (type=DAEMON_ABORT) which indicate the audit 
  daemon has been forcefully terminated or crashed. This is a high-severity event 
  as it may indicate an attacker has successfully killed the audit daemon to evade 
  detection, or a critical system failure affecting security monitoring capabilities.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  logging enabled. The auditd service must be configured to log daemon events. 
  The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  DAEMON_ABORT events are rare and typically indicate a serious issue. Possible 
  legitimate causes include severe resource exhaustion, kernel panics, or critical 
  system errors. Any occurrence should be investigated thoroughly.

response:
  message: >
    CRITICAL: Auditd daemon abort event detected on $agent_name$. 
    The audit daemon was forcefully terminated. This may indicate an attacker 
    killing the audit service or a critical system failure. Immediate investigation required.
