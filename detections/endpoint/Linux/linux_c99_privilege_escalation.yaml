description: >
  Detects the execution of the c99 utility with sudo privileges and the -wrapper 
  flag, which can lead to privilege escalation on Linux systems. The c99 compiler 
  front-end can be abused to spawn shells through the wrapper mechanism, allowing 
  attackers to execute commands as root.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility 
  including the gcc compilation chain triggered by c99.

known_false_positives: >
  Developers may legitimately use c99 for compiling C programs. However, the 
  -wrapper flag with shell paths (/bin/sh, /bin/bash) is rarely used legitimately.
  Filter based on known development environments and expected usage patterns.
