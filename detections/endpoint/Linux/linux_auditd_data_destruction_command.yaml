description: >
  Detects the use of the rm command with --no-preserve-root flag, which bypasses 
  the safety mechanism preventing recursive deletion of the root filesystem. This 
  technique is associated with destructive malware like AwfulShred and indicates 
  an attempt to cause significant data destruction on the target system.

  - Tetragon
  - Linux Auditd

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to 
  capture command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index 
  naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Very rare in legitimate use. The --no-preserve-root flag is explicitly designed 
  to bypass safety mechanisms and should almost never be used in normal operations. 
  Any detection should be treated as highly suspicious.
