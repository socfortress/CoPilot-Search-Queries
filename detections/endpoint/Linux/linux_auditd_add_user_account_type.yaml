description: >
  Detects auditd ADD_USER events which indicate a new user account has been created 
  on the system. Adversaries may create local accounts to maintain persistence on 
  compromised systems. This detection captures user creation events directly from 
  the auditd subsystem for comprehensive account monitoring.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  logging enabled. The auditd service must be configured to log user account 
  events. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators creating legitimate user accounts, automated provisioning 
  systems, and configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet, Chef) may trigger 
  this detection. Correlate with change management records and authorized personnel.
