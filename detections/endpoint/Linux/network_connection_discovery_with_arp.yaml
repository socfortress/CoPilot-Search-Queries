description: >
  Detects the execution of arp.exe with the -a flag, used to list network connections 
  and ARP cache entries on a system. Both Red Teams and adversaries use arp.exe for 
  situational awareness and network discovery. Used by Volt Typhoon, Qakbot, IcedID, 
  and Prestige/Interlock ransomware for network reconnaissance prior to lateral movement.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Windows endpoints with Sysmon 
  installed and configured to log process creation events (EventID 1) with full 
  command-line arguments. Ensure the Sysmon configuration does not exclude arp.exe 
  from logging. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention. 
  Note: This detection was not validated with a live simulation as the Sysmon config 
  in the lab environment excludes arp.exe. Query logic and field mappings are validated 
  from previous detections.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators or power users may use arp -a for legitimate network troubleshooting. 
  Filter based on parent process context and frequency. Multiple arp executions in 
  a short time window increases confidence of malicious activity.
