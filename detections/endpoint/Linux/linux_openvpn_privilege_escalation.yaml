description: >
  Detects the execution of OpenVPN with elevated privileges, specifically when 
  combined with the --dev, --script-security, and --up options. This GTFOBins 
  technique abuses OpenVPN's script execution capability to run arbitrary commands 
  as root, potentially leading to full system compromise.

data_source:
  - auth.log
  - Tetragon

  END_TIME:
    description: "Query end time (ISO 8601 or relative)"

    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-02-04 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility 
  including the commands executed via OpenVPN's --up scripts.

known_false_positives: >
  Legitimate VPN configurations may use --up scripts for routing or DNS configuration. 
  Filter based on known administrative activities and expected script paths.
