description: >
  Detects the execution of SysReq commands to reboot a Linux system host. The pattern 
  'echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger' is used to force an immediate system reboot without 
  unmounting filesystems. This technique was observed in the AwfulShred malware wiper 
  and indicates potential destructive activity.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. The index pattern should match your 
  Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  SysRq usage is very rare in normal operations and is typically only used for 
  debugging kernel issues. Any detection should be thoroughly investigated.

    SysRq activity detected on $agent_name$. 
    The sysrq-trigger can be used to force system reboots or other kernel actions. 
    This is commonly used in destructive malware like AwfulShred. MITRE ATT&CK: $rule_mitre_id$
