description: >
  Detects the creation or modification of files in the /etc/profile.d directory on 
  Linux systems. This directory is used for persistence by executing scripts upon 
  system boot or user login. Adversaries may place malicious scripts here to maintain 
  long-term access, associated with malware like Kaiji.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  process execution logging enabled. Auth.log monitoring provides sudo command 
  visibility. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators may create scripts in profile.d for automation purposes during 
  system configuration. Package installations may also add scripts to this directory. 
  Filter based on known administrative operations.
