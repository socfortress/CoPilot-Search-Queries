description: >
  Detects the execution of Puppet commands with elevated privileges, specifically 
  when Puppet is used to apply configurations with sudo rights using the exec 
  resource type. This indicates a potential privilege escalation attempt where a 
  user could gain root access and execute system commands as root. Puppet's exec 
  resource can run arbitrary commands, making it a powerful privilege escalation 
  vector.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring and Tetragon process execution logging enabled. Puppet must be 
  installed on the system for exploitation.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators may use puppet apply for legitimate configuration 
  management. However, the combination of sudo + puppet apply -e with exec 
  resources from command line is uncommon in production environments. Filter 
  based on known automation pipelines and CI/CD systems.

    Puppet privilege escalation detected on $agent_name$. 
    The sudo puppet apply -e exec pattern can execute arbitrary commands as root.
