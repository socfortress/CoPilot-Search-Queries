description: >
  Detects potential usage of ngrok on Linux systems by searching for
  ngrok-related strings in log fields. Ngrok is commonly abused by attackers
  to expose internal services to the internet and establish command-and-control
  tunnels.

  - Wazuh Agent Logs
  - Syslog

parameters:
  AGENT_NAME:
    description: "Target agent/host name"
    type: string
    required: true
    example: "Amine"

  CUSTOMER_CODE:
    description: "Customer label for filtering"
    type: string

    example: "lab"

  START_TIME:
    description: "Query start time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now-24h"
    example: "2026-01-27 00:00:00.000"

  END_TIME:
    description: "Query end time (ISO 8601 or relative)"
    type: datetime
    required: false
    default: "now"
    example: "2026-01-27 23:59:59.999"

how_to_implement: >
  This detection relies on Wazuh agents collecting application and command
  execution logs on Linux systems. Ensure logging is configured to capture
  process output and application messages.

known_false_positives: >
  Legitimate developer usage of ngrok for testing or debugging purposes.
  Consider allowlisting known developer hosts or users if necessary.
