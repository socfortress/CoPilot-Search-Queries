description: >
  Detects the execution of the GNU Debugger (GDB) with specific flags (-nx, -ex) 
  that indicate an attempt to escalate privileges on a Linux system. The -ex flag 
  with shell escape (!) allows execution of system commands as root, potentially 
  leading to a root shell.

  - auth.log
  - Tetragon

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auth.log 
  monitoring enabled. Tetragon provides additional process execution visibility.

known_false_positives: >
  Developers and security researchers may legitimately use GDB for debugging. 
  However, the combination of -nx and -ex with shell escapes (!) is rarely used 
  legitimately. Filter based on known development environments.
