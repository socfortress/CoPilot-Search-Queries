description: >
  Detects deletion of SSH configuration files and keys from /etc/ssh/ or user .ssh/ 
  directories using rm, shred, or unlink commands. Adversaries may delete SSH keys 
  and configurations to disrupt remote access, cover their tracks after establishing 
  alternate persistence mechanisms, or as part of a destructive attack aimed at 
  denying legitimate administrators access to systems.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to 
  capture command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index 
  naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators may legitimately rotate or remove old SSH keys as part of 
  key management practices. Automated key rotation scripts may also trigger this 
  detection. User account deprovisioning processes may delete user SSH directories.
