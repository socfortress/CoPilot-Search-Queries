description: >
  Detects the use of the split command with the -b (bytes) flag to break files into 
  smaller parts of specific sizes. This may indicate an attacker attempting to evade 
  data transfer size limits or network detection mechanisms during data exfiltration 
  by splitting sensitive files into smaller, less conspicuous chunks.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to 
  capture command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index 
  naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators may legitimately use split with -b flag for log rotation, 
  backup operations, or file management tasks. Automated scripts that process large 
  files may also trigger this detection. Filter based on user context and file paths.
