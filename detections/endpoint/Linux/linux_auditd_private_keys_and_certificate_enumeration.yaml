description: >
  Detects suspicious attempts to find private keys and certificates, which may 
  indicate an attacker's effort to access sensitive cryptographic information. 
  Private keys are crucial for securing encrypted communications and data, and 
  unauthorized access to them can lead to severe security breaches, including 
  data decryption and identity theft.

  - Tetragon

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. The index pattern should match your 
  Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System processes like apt-key may legitimately search for GPG keys during package 
  verification. Administrators may search for certificates during troubleshooting. 
  Filter based on known system processes and authorized users.
