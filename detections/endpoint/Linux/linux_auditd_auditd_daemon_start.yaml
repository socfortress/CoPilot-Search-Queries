description: >
  Detects auditd daemon start events (type=DAEMON_START) which indicate the audit 
  daemon has been started or restarted. While this is often legitimate during system 
  boot or maintenance, unexpected daemon restarts could indicate an attacker attempting 
  to clear audit logs or manipulate the auditing system to evade detection.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with auditd 
  logging enabled. The auditd service must be configured to log daemon events. 
  The index pattern should match your Wazuh index naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System reboots, scheduled maintenance, and legitimate administrative actions 
  will trigger auditd daemon start events. Correlate with system boot times and 
  change management windows to reduce false positives.
