description: >
  Detects the execution of wbadmin.exe with arguments indicating file recovery 
  from backup. Adversaries may abuse this to restore sensitive files such as SAM, 
  SYSTEM hives, or previously dropped payloads from prior backups to regain access 
  or re-establish persistence after cleanup.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Windows endpoints with Sysmon 
  installed and configured to log process creation events (EventID 1) with full 
  command-line arguments.

known_false_positives: >
  Administrators may use WBAdmin to restore files during approved recovery or 
  testing activities. Validate the user context and whether the recovery was part 
  of an authorized workflow.
