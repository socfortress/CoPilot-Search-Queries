description: >
  Detects the execution of the at daemon (atd) or at command which is used to schedule 
  tasks for one-time execution at a specified time. Adversaries may abuse the at utility 
  to schedule malicious tasks for persistence or delayed execution of payloads to evade 
  detection during active monitoring periods.

how_to_implement: >
  This detection requires Wazuh agents deployed on Linux endpoints with Tetragon 
  or auditd process execution logging enabled. Ensure the agent is configured to 
  capture command-line arguments. The index pattern should match your Wazuh index 
  naming convention.

known_false_positives: >
  System administrators and automation scripts may legitimately use the at command 
  for scheduling one-time tasks. Backup scripts and maintenance jobs may also use 
  at for delayed execution. Correlate with authorized task scheduling activities.
